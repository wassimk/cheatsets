# Cheatsets

These are my personal cheat sheets written for the [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) app. They are mostly shortcut keys and commands for apps like *Vim* and *tmux*. Most simple things that are typically known like `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` for Vim have been left out on purpose.

## How do I generate them?

First, install the [cheatset](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatset) gem:

``` bash
$ gem install cheatset
```

Generate cheatsets with:

``` bash
$ cheatset generate filename.rb
```

This will create a folder with a `.docset` extension. These are for Dash. Just open them to import.
