# Cheatsets

These are my personal cheat sheets written for the Dash application. Mostly about shortcut keys for applications.

## How do I generate them?

First, install the cheatset gem.

``` bash
$ gem install cheatset
```

Generate cheatsets with:

``` bash
$ cheatset generate filename.rb
```

It will create a folder with a `.docset` extension. These are for Dash. Just open them to import into Dash.
